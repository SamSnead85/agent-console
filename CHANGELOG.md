# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Published installation checks fail on missing packages and run after release
  assets upload. Development availability may explicitly report a pending
  release; it no longer presents a missing download as a verified installation.
- Release packaging verifies the selected source's main-branch ancestry and
  successful CI, public-safety and performance checks before producing assets.
- Usage batches are indexed only after successful persistence. Failed writes
  preserve earlier batches, allow safe retries, and recover incomplete final
  lines before rebuilding the index after a restart.
- Only one hub can own a state directory, including when different listening
  ports or directory aliases are used. A crashed owner's lock can be recovered;
  an owner that cannot be verified is never displaced automatically.
- [Architecture diagrams](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) document collection, enrollment,
  trust boundaries, delivery controls and the separate future MCP integration.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-09-24

Security fixes, accounting you can reconcile, and a console that is nearly
free when idle. Upgrade from 0.2.1: this release fixes three security issues,
described in advisory
[GHSA-grq6-4rfv-hxhj](https://github.com/SamSnead85/agent-console/security/advisories/GHSA-grq6-4rfv-hxhj).

**Security**

- **The join page checks the whole link before it offers a command.** It
  rebuilds the link from the parts it checked and puts it in single quotes, and
  gives no command for a link it cannot vouch for. The console's commands use
  single quotes too, and the reporter accepts a link with the quotes that
  cmd.exe passes through.
- **Add a machine leads with the command to send.** It is built on the
  console's own computer; the link, which opens a page served over plain HTTP,
  is the alternative. `SECURITY.md` explains the choice.
- **A second start never sends the console's key.** It proves it can read the
  key instead, and prints a sign-in link or opens the browser only for a
  console that proved it holds the same key. Something else answering on the
  port is told nothing, and the second start says so.
- **Each browser has its own session.** Sessions are random, last 30 days and
  end with the new **Sign out**; the console keeps only a verifier of each, and
  a new key ends them all. Each console's cookie has a name of its own, so
  signing in to one console on a computer no longer signs you out of another.
  Everyone signs in once more after upgrading.

**Accounting**

- **[docs/accounting.md](docs/accounting.md)** defines one token event, what
  is counted once (streaming, re-written lines, retries, resumed sessions,
  compaction, subagents, copies), Codex's cumulative counters, classes and
  cache lifetimes, models, windows and time zones, who a session belongs to,
  team roll-up and cost.
- **A conformance suite**, `@lockedinlabs/agent-console/conformance`: synthetic
  logs for five machines and two people, exact expected totals summed from
  ground truth, and the collector's own output for other receivers to replay.
- **Fixed: a streamed Claude response is dated by its first line.** Its later
  increments were dated by their own lines, so a response that crossed a
  window edge was split across two windows.
- **Fixed: a Codex counter that restarts is counted.** The restarting request,
  including every forked child's first own request, was dropped as coverage
  debt.
- **Fixed: "last 24 hours" is exactly the last 1,440 minutes.** The console's
  day included one extra minute and any record dated ahead of the hub's clock.
- The hub keeps 5-minute, 1-hour and unknown-lifetime cache writes apart, and
  `lib/hub/accounting.js` reports exact totals for any whole-minute window by
  team, person, machine, model, session and session tree.

**Performance**

- **Faster, and nearly free when idle.** On a month of heavy history (a
  million transcript lines), the first read takes half the time and half the
  memory, and the console keeps answering while it runs. An idle console used
  a quarter of a CPU core and rewrote tens of megabytes every five seconds;
  it now uses under 3% and writes nothing. Unchanged transcripts are not
  reopened, the cursor no longer grows with history, and lines no record
  reads are not parsed. Every record is byte for byte the same. A benchmark
  on synthetic history (`bench/`) and a budget CI enforces are in
  [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md).

**How the project is kept**

- **[docs/PRINCIPLES.md](docs/PRINCIPLES.md)**: the bar every change meets,
  and where CI checks it. New checks: the README's install line is run
  against the published release; every console option is started in
  `--demo`; a pull request that changes what people run adds a changelog line,
  and one that changes the interface retakes or confirms its screenshots.
  SECURITY.md now says how quickly a report is answered and fixed.
- **A public-safety gate on every push and pull request.** gitleaks checks each
  new commit and the tree. `npm run check:public` refuses absolute home paths,
  private email addresses, machine network names, credential shapes, image
  metadata, and names on a private denylist that CI reads from a repository
  secret, in files, in every line a commit added, in commit identities and in
  a pull request's title and body. It reports where and which rule, never the
  text. `scripts/public-safety/strip-images.mjs` removes image metadata without
  re-encoding.
- **The privacy canary covers everything that leaves a machine**: whole
  requests (path and headers as well as body), every answer the hub sends
  back, every read the console serves, and the hub's own transcripts, which
  must never leave through the reporting port. A new GET route that the
  canary does not read fails the suite.

**Fixed**

- **About one generated certificate in 256 was invalid,** so a hub could fail
  to start at random.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-23

Safer by default, and the fixes from a first-time install.

**Security**

- **Agent Console now comes only from its GitHub release.** The console no
  longer serves the package to machines that join, and every command it prints
  installs the release over HTTPS. From this release on, CI builds each release's
  package with a published SHA-256 and a signed build attestation.
- **Reports are encrypted and pinned.** Joining and reporting go over TLS to a
  certificate the console makes for itself; the join link carries its
  fingerprint, and the reporter talks to that certificate only.
- **The console is signed in, and never on the network.** It listens on
  127.0.0.1 on its own port and needs a sign-in cookie; `--open` and the
  sign-in link printed at start set it. Other machines use a separate port
  (normally 6788) that serves only joining and reporting, refuses callers
  outside private networks unless `--allow-public`, and refuses proxied requests
  to the console.
- **Joining is harder to guess.** Links carry a 128-bit code that lives at most
  an hour; attempts are counted before they are read.
- **The console checks every record's exact shape**, keeps usage one file per
  day, reads it back line by line, and limits each machine to 250,000 records a
  day, so a bad or hostile reporter cannot stop it from starting.
- **The reporter trusts nothing it is sent.** It checks every identifier a
  console returns and strips control characters before printing. Project hashes
  use a key only the reporting machine holds. Leaving out
  `--share-project-names` stops names at once, and `leave` deletes everything
  the enrolment left behind.

**Fixed**

- A machine with a large history now finishes uploading. It keeps every batch
  the console accepted, resumes where it stopped, honours the console's pacing,
  and shows "catching up · N of M records" meanwhile. The console no longer
  shows it as "Reporting · now" until everything has arrived.
- The reporter says what actually went wrong instead of always "cannot reach
  the hub".
- Messages count API responses, not transcript lines (the count was 64% high
  for Claude). Tokens were never affected.
- The burn rate shows "unpriced" instead of "$0.00/hour" for models without a
  verified price.
- A busy port: a second start points at the console already running; another
  program on the default port moves the console to the next free one.
- The first read of a long history shows its progress, and the browser opens
  after two seconds.

**Added**

- Claude Opus 5.5 pricing, from Anthropic's published pricing page
  (checked 2026-09-22).
- `--version`, clearer install steps, the full LockedIn Labs lockup in the
  README, and the community and licence files an open-source project needs.

**Changed**

- Machines that joined a 0.2.0 console join again with a new link.
- The v0.1 detail endpoints (`/api`, `/api/history`) and the embeddable panel
  are gone; the Projects view now reads the console's own data.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-22

Many machines, one console. Agent Console now shows the AI coding agents on
every computer you connect, in LockedIn Labs' console design.

- **Connect other computers by link.** One computer runs the console (the hub);
  **Add a machine** makes a join link with a single-use code that expires in 30
  minutes. The other computer opens it and runs one command — `npx` fetches
  Agent Console from the hub itself — and it starts reporting within seconds.
  Each machine gets its own device token, stored privately on that machine and
  kept on the hub only as a verifier; **Remove** revokes it at once. The console
  shows who joined and when.
- **A team view.** The total across every machine, and per machine and per
  person — tokens, share, cache read and cache write shares, model split and
  list-price cost, over 24 hours or 7 days. One person's several machines (or
  several accounts) roll up into one row; a transcript copied between machines
  is counted once.
- **The console, redesigned.** The terminal look is gone. IBM Plex (shipped with
  the package, SIL OFL 1.1), a graphite ground, one cobalt accent, colour only
  for state, light and dark themes. The band shows tokens for the last 24 hours
  with the cache read / cache write / output / input split and each class's share
  of all tokens; tokens over time (1H · 24H · 7D); burn right now in tok/min and
  tok/s with per-model share and spend; and one lane per session with its model,
  hour of activity, five-minute tokens, subagents and machine. Show unavailable
  and Pause motion sit in the band's header. One animation loop, text redrawn at
  most eight times a second, `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured.
- **Gaps shown as gaps.** A machine that stops reporting shows when it was last heard
  from, is left out of "right now" by name, and its lanes read unknown rather
  than zero; the chart marks where it becomes incomplete. A missing token class
  makes a total a floor, and an unpriced model is excluded from dollars and named.
- **The collector.** LockedIn Labs' dependency-free collector is now part of the
  package (`lib/collector/`, with its tests and [contract](docs/COLLECTOR-CONTRACT.md)):
  portable salted record identity, cursors per destination, a write-ahead spool,
  bounded retries, and a verified offline price table covering current Claude
  and OpenAI models.
- **Privacy, proven.** Only counts, model ids, timestamps and salted hashes leave
  a machine. An end-to-end test runs real reporter and hub processes over
  canary-filled transcripts and checks every byte on the wire and on disk.
  `--share-project-names` is the one opt-in, and sends a folder's name, never
  its path.
- **Network posture.** The hub still binds `127.0.0.1` by default. `--listen`
  opens only the join page, the package, the join exchange and token-checked
  reporting to other computers, with a printed warning; the console and every
  administrative action answer only on the hub's own computer.
- **Demo mode** is a synthetic team of five machines, stamped DEMO on every
  view, reading nothing and accepting no machine.
- **Projects** (tokens and Git delivery evidence for the hub's own computer) is
  one click away instead of on the first screen.

Breaking: Node.js 22 or newer is required. The v0.1 session-roster page and its
browser modules are removed; `/api`, `/api/history` and `<agent-console-panel>`
still work.

Limits: the reporter runs while its window is open (no background service is
installed); on Windows, CI covers the hub, collector, joining and reporting but
not yet the Projects view; the hub serves plain HTTP, so use it on a network you
trust or behind a VPN or tunnel.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-20

First public standalone Agent Console release. The local observability console
is available without a coordination CLI, ledger, account, or build step.

- Preserve the dark instrument-panel interface, session trees, token composition,
  history, activity signals, and delivery evidence.
- Add verified Fable 5.1/Mythos 5.1 pricing with their model-specific cache rates.
- Preserve unknown subagent costs and exclude metadata journals from agent counts.
- Make legacy coordination opt-in; keep the default demo focused on local usage.
- Add explicit transcript-root configuration and clearer device/Claude scope.
- Add exact bucket details to the history chart on hover.
- Publish installable GitHub release artifacts, source, synthetic screenshots,
  measurement documentation, and automated macOS/Linux checks.

Limits: Codex costs and combined period totals, native installers, multi-device
collection, and team aggregation are not implemented in this release.
